Our workflow generates and exports satellite imagery data from Google Earth Engine for analysis in Tensorflow.  This analysis predicts the probability of the presence of a solar array as a function of the visible, infrared, and near infrared bands in Sentinel-2 imagery.  The model is a [fully convolutional neural network (FCNN)](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf), specifically [U-net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).  This relatively simple model is a mostly unmodified version of [this example](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/samples/outreach/blogs/segmentation_blogpost/image_segmentation.ipynb) from the TensorFlow docs.

It's worth noting that to build the training and testing data for the FCNN, you export a single TFRecord file that contains patches of pixel values in each record.  You do NOT need to export each training/testing patch to a different image.  Since each record potentially contains a lot of data (especially with big patches or many input bands), some manual sharding of the computation is necessary to avoid the `computed value too large` error.
